npm is the world's largest Software Registry. The registry contains over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers use npm to share software.
This npm command is used for installing the third party modules in our current directory.

3.npm install express
----
Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

4.npm install ejs
----
Embedded JavaScript templating.

5.npm install nodemon
----
nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

6.Install Homebrew
----
Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didnâ€™t.
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/maste
r/install)"
2. Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap
brew tap mongodb/brew
3. Install MongoDB
brew install mongodb-community@4.0
4. Run MongoDB
brew services start mongodb
5. Connect and Use MongoDB
mongo

#7. Use the migrated distribution from custom tap

brew services start mongodb-community
8.npm install mongodb
9.npm install mongoose
----
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, while Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node. js that provides a higher-level abstraction layer on top of MongoDB, allowing developers to define data models using a schema-based approach.

10.npm install express-ejs-layouts
----
This is where EJS Layouts come in and help us create projects that are easier to maintain.
And for Partials, they are a common templating concept where the idea is to create reusable files that can be reused.

11.npm install cookie-parser
----
Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.
